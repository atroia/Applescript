# Applescripts
Just some applescript files that have helped speed up my workflow


**getPath.scpt**

Simple script to find the POSIX file path of a selected file. I use this with some workflows in Alfred. Note: This was copied and slightly modified from a KeyboardMaestro forum post. The url to that post is https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/getting-the-path-of-currently-selected-file-in-finder/1507/2
