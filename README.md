# Applescripts
Just some applescript files that have helped speed up my workflow

**createAssignmentsFromList.scpt**

Script to create InCopy Assignments in InDesign from a list in a text file (it might still have some bugs that I need to work out but so far it's doing what I need it to do).

Simply save a list (with hard returns) in a text file of all the assignment names you would like in your document (Frontmatter, Preface, Chapter 1, Chapter 2, etc.) and run the script. The script will prompt you to select the text file you saved and then it will create a new assignment for each line item in the file.


**getPath.scpt**

Simple script to find the POSIX file path of a selected file. I use this with some workflows in Alfred. **_Note:_** This was copied and slightly modified from a KeyboardMaestro forum post. The url to that post is https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/getting-the-path-of-currently-selected-file-in-finder/1507/2
