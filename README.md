# Applescripts
Just some applescript files that have helped speed up my workflow

**createAssignmentsFromList.scpt**

Script to create InCopy Assignments in InDesign from a list in a text file (it might still have some bugs that I need to work out but so far it's doing what I need it to do).


**getPath.scpt**

Simple script to find the POSIX file path of a selected file. I use this with some workflows in Alfred. **_Note:_** This was copied and slightly modified from a KeyboardMaestro forum post. The url to that post is https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/getting-the-path-of-currently-selected-file-in-finder/1507/2
