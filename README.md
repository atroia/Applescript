# Applescripts
Just some applescript files that have helped speed up my workflow


*fileSize.scpt*
Simple script that takes a selected file in Finder and double checks the size against Nookpress's 20MB limit and displays a notification if the file is VALID or INVALID.

*getPath.scpt*
Simple script to find the POSIX file path of a selected file. I use this with some workflows in Alfred. Note: This was copied and slightly modified from a KeyboardMaestro forum post. The url to that post is https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/getting-the-path-of-currently-selected-file-in-finder/1507/2
