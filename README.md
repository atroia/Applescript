# Applescripts
Just some applescript files that have helped speed up my workflow

****
**getPath**

Simple script to find the POSIX file path of a selected file. I use this with some workflows in Alfred. **_Note:_** This was copied and slightly modified from a KeyboardMaestro forum post. The url to that post is https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/getting-the-path-of-currently-selected-file-in-finder/1507/2

**mountDriveOrSearch**

This script will first search for the specific mounted network drive. If the network drive is not mounted, it will mount the drive and search prompt (Alfred) will appear. If the network drive is mounted, the search prompt (Alfred) will appear.

**mountDriveOrSearch2**

This script will first search for the specific mounted network drive. If the network drive is not mounted, it will mount the drive and the search prompt (Alfred) will appear. If the network drive is mounted, the search prompt (Alfred) will appear. This script will also make a list of the folders in the parent folder of the drive and list them in a window prompt. Once the folder has been selected from the list the search prompt (Alfred) will appear and you can search that folder from Alfred.

ISBN-13 Check Digit Check. Enter your 12 ISBN digits and you will get your check digit back.

**createFolderStructure**

**changeExtension**

Change all the extensions of files of one file type to another. Currently default set to change HTML file extensions to PHP.

****
**createJobFolders**

This script will create an Ebook working folder structure within a parent folder. Folders are "~finals", "~src", "EPUB2", "EPUB3", and "KF8".

****
**Hard_Cover_Dimensions**

This script will help with the math in determining the max width of a hard cover book file.

****
**mapTradebooksDrive**

Sometimes our network can be frustrating to find things on. So I have started mapping each drive to separate text files to search via GREP within Sublime for a easier and more expansive search (as I am basically search all the level 1 folders on all the drives at the same time). This script will help update the one Volume that will update the most frequently as new folders are added.

****
**PDF Page Count**

I needed a script for Adobe Acrobat that I could tie to a keyboard shortcut would checkthe page count against 16 page signatures for publishing purposes.
